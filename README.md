Game Mechanics
The game starts with a single level and progresses through multiple levels.
A fruit (represented by an image) falls from a random position at the top of the canvas.
The player controls a basket at the bottom of the screen using the left and right arrow keys.
The goal is to catch the falling fruit in the basket.
If the fruit reaches the bottom without being caught, the game shows a "You Lose" message.
If the player catches the fruit, the game progresses to the next level.
The game ends after completing all levels or if the player loses.
